<a name="introduction"></a>Overview
---------------------------------------

Module 1's quiz is on lectures and readings from Feb. 1 through Feb. 24.  The following topic list is a guide, and we may update it before the quiz in response to student questions.  See the slides and recordings for more details and readings associated with these topics.  A basic rule we'll try to follow is this: if it's in the readings, but we didn't mention it in lecture, it will *not* be on the quiz.

<h2 id="how-the-quiz-will-be-given-and-other-rules">How the Quiz Will Be
Given and Other Rules</h2>
<p>The quizzes will first be given on paper and in-class on 9/21/2021.
You can try one, two or three of the quizzes in the class that day. On
the 2nd quiz day, 10/7/2021, you can re-take any or all of these. You
can also re-take any or all of these during the final exam period.</p>
<p>The quizzes will be closed-book, closed-notes, etc. Getting
information from any electronic devices is not allowed while taking a
quiz. You will sign a pledge on each quiz paper.</p>
<p>It is an honor violation to communicate information about the quiz to
anyone who might not have yet taken it.</p>
<h2
id="topics-that-might-be-covered-on-the-module-1-quiz-include">Topics
that might be covered on the Module 1 quiz include:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Basic Terms and concepts: algorithm, basic operation,
brute-force, Worst-case, average-case, best-case</p></li>
<li><p>Asymptotic growth rate; order classes; BigTheta and all the
others</p>
<ul>
<li>Definitions and their conceptual meaning</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Lower bounds, optimal algorithms</p></li>
<li><p>Insertion sort: worst-case complexity; what are its
advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>The lower bound argument about sorts that only swap adjacent
keys</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The divide and conquer design strategy (D&amp;C) -Writing simple
recursive divide and conquer algorithms</p></li>
<li><p>Mergesort: its D&amp;C strategy and recurrences</p>
<ul>
<li>Need to know merge is linear, but not any details on its
implementation</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Quicksort:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s the overall D&amp;C strategy?</li>
<li>Partition: only algorithm in the book (the one in the slides). (This
is not Hoare’s partition; it’s called Lomuto’s partition). How it works,
its worst-case, its time-coplexity etc.</li>
<li>For Quicksort, what’s the recurrence of the worst-case? the
best-case?</li>
<li>What leads to the worst-case? How can we prevent this? (randomized
choice of pivot value, estimates of median, etc.)</li>
<li>Average case for QS: Know the bottom line. Don’t need to know the
details explained on pp. 176-178.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Stablity and space complexities of sorts: insertion sort,
quicksort, mergesort</p></li>
<li><p>Decision trees and lower-bound arguments for comparison
sorting.</p></li>
<li><p>About the HW for this module: make sure you understand the timing
results you saw for the various experiments</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="topics-that-might-be-covered-on-the-module-2-quiz-include">Topics
that might be covered on the Module 2 quiz include:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Writing recurrence relations for D&amp;C algorithms</p></li>
<li><p>Reducing recurrences to closed form using the direct
(“unrolling”) method, substituion (including simple induction
proofs)</p></li>
<li><p>Using the Master theorem</p></li>
<li><p>About the HW for this module: there may possibly be similar
problems to what was on the HW for this module</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="topics-that-might-be-covered-on-the-module-3-quiz-include">Topics
that might be covered on the Module 3 quiz include:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Closest-pair of points problem, including strategy,
time-complexity, topics related to “the strip”</p></li>
<li><p>Strassens’ matrix multiplication. Just know the general ideas
that make this algorithms interesting, including the recurrences. (No
details on implementation.)</p></li>
<li><p>Know how Quickselect can find order statistics, and its basic
time-complexity</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the need for a good pivot, and that median of medians
finds a good enough pivot to make Quickselect linear.</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the strategy of median of medians</li>
<li>You do not need how to derive the recurrence for its use with
Quickselect or how to use induction to reduce it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>About the HW for this module: we will not ask about
implementation details, but there may be questions about handling points
in “the strip” and logic or time-complexity issues about that part of
the algorithm</p></li>

<li>The details of the matrix algebra that make Strassen’s algorithm
calculate the right product</li>
