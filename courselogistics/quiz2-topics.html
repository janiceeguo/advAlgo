<h1 id="cs4102---quiz-2-topics-and-information">CS4102 - Quiz 2 Topics
and Information</h1>
<p><a href="../index.html">Back to Main Page</a></p>
<h2 id="overview"><a name="introduction"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>Module 2’s quiz is on lectures and readings from March 1 through
March 17. The following topic list is a guide, and we may update it
before the quiz in response to student questions. See the slides and
recordings for more details and readings associated with these topics. A
basic rule we’ll try to follow is this: if it’s in the readings, but we
didn’t mention it in lecture, it will <em>not</em> be on the quiz.</p>
<p>Document Version: 1.1, March 26, 10:00am</p>
<h2 id="how-the-quiz-will-be-given-and-other-rules">How the Quiz Will Be
Given and Other Rules</h2>
<p>We will use Gradescope this time for Quiz 2 (and re-takes of Quiz 1).
Each quiz will be visible like any other assignment in your list of
assignments in Gradescope during the “quiz window”, which means you can
start it anytime during a 30-hour time-period starting on Friday, March
26, noon (Charlottesville time). You have 75 minutes to complete it once
you start. The latest you should start is 6:00 pm on Saturday, March 27
(Charlottesville time).</p>
<p>So you can see what a Gradescope quiz looks like, there is a very
simple sample quiz available now you can try.</p>
<p>Quiz 2 and Quiz 1’s re-take will each be about 10 multiple choice or
T/F questions.</p>
<p>Just as if the quiz were being given in person during its original
time-slot, we will answer Piazza and Discord questions to help you
prepare for the quiz up until shortly before the quiz window opens. But
we will not answer any questions when the quiz window opens until the
quiz window ends. This is to be fair and not to give an advantage to
those who start it later.</p>
<h2 id="honor-rules-resources-communication-with-others">Honor Rules,
Resources, Communication with Others</h2>
<p>The following describes what resources you can use while you take the
quiz.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may reference the book, the notes you prepared while taking the
classes, materials on the Collab and course website including slides and
videos, your HW solutions, and any other resource created by you or the
CS4102 staff as part of the course. (Your notes may be written, on your
computer or in your own documents stored in the cloud.)</li>
<li>You may refer to postings on the class Piazza site or Discord, but
you cannot ask any kind of question on these forums once you start the
quiz until the end of the entire quiz window. (Other students might not
have started the quiz, so this would be a breach of the honor
policy.)</li>
<li>Your answers must fully be your own work, with no assistance or
collaboration with anyone else.</li>
<li>You are not allowed to communicate with anyone other than course
staff about the quiz or course material while taking it.</li>
<li>After taking it you are not allowed to communicate with anyone else
about the quiz if that person may not have taken it yet or if that
communication might reach someone who has not taken it.</li>
<li>If our tools identify solutions that appear to be too similar, we
may ask you to explain your answer orally to a member of the course
staff.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Pledge:</em> By submitting a CS4102 quiz, you are pledging that
you have followed all rules regarding assistance, communication, and
resource use described here. (Currently there is no Gradescope question
or entry about a Pledge, so the act of submitting means you’re
pledging.)</p>
<h2 id="about-the-honor-policy-for-this-quiz">About the Honor Policy for
this Quiz</h2>
<p>Before you take our quiz, we’d like to remind you about our rules and
the Honor Pledge (as documented in the document linked above), and your
commitment to your own personal integrity. With education moving online
across the country, reports of cheating on exams are in the news at UVA
and everywhere.</p>
<p>It’s hard to explain how disappointing cheating is for a professor
who’s worked hard to make a fair and reasonable exam that can be
delivered online to students given this current unfortunate situation
with the pandemic. The world is a tough place right now, but how
individuals react, the decisions they make, and the actions they take in
hard times help define who someone is. Of course we instructors would be
disappointed to learn of cheating in the course, but frankly it’s not
about us but about you. What you do says something (to you, to others)
about the kind of person you believe you are and the kind of person you
want to be.</p>
<p>So we urge you to be the right kind of person. You can be, you ought
to want to be, you probably are all or most of the time. But making the
wrong decision when you’ve been asked to commit to and pledge that
you’ve followed rules for academic integrity is a mistake that damages
your personal integrity in return for a grade in a class. In the long
term, a grade matters much less than the kind of person you believe you
are and what your actions show you to be.</p>
<p>We’ve put in a fair bit of thinking and effort to make things easier
for you this term with our system of grading, the chance to re-take
quizzes, etc. We need to balance the need to get an accurate assessment
of your success in learning with making your lives reasaonably bearable.
To take advantage of us as we’re trying to do things the right way is
wrong and does you damage.</p>
<p>All the best in these difficult times of pandemic and online
learning! We hope you do great on quizzes, projects, etc., but what we
want more is for you to be good people. We believe you can be and want
to be, so be that!</p>
