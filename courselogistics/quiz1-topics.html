and Information</h1>

<h2 id="overview"><a name="introduction"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>Module 1’s quiz is on lectures and readings from Feb. 1 through
Feb. 24. The following topic list is a guide, and we may update it
before the quiz in response to student questions. See the slides and
recordings for more details and readings associated with these topics. A
basic rule we’ll try to follow is this: if it’s in the readings, but we
didn’t mention it in lecture, it will <em>not</em> be on the quiz.</p>
<p>Document Version: 1.0, March 2, 5:00pm</p>
<h2 id="how-the-quiz-will-be-given-and-other-rules">How the Quiz Will Be
Given and Other Rules</h2>
<p><em>Important!</em> Read <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EForD2P6JuUZdGUC_p5FOQI_JyZx1nXaKAsHZCtw2TU/edit?usp=sharing">this
document</a> for info about how the quiz will be given, what the rules
are, etc.</p>
<h2 id="honor-policy-for-this-quiz">Honor Policy for this Quiz</h2>
<p>Before you take our quiz, we’d like to remind you about our rules and
the Honor Pledge (as documented in the document linked above), and your
commitment to your own personal integrity. With education moving online
across the country, reports of cheating on exams are in the news at UVA
and everywhere.</p>
<p>It’s hard to explain how disappointing cheating is for a professor
who’s worked hard to make a fair and reasonable exam that can be
delivered online to students given this current unfortunate situation
with the pandemic. The world is a tough place right now, but how
individuals react, the decisions they make, and the actions they take in
hard times help define who someone is. Of course we instructors would be
disappointed to learn of cheating in the course, but frankly it’s not
about us but about you. What you do says something (to you, to others)
about the kind of person you believe you are and the kind of person you
want to be.</p>
<p>So we urge you to be the right kind of person. You can be, you ought
to want to be, you probably are all or most of the time. But making the
wrong decision when you’ve been asked to commit to and pledge that
you’ve followed rules for academic integrity is a mistake that damages
your personal integrity in return for a grade in a class. In the long
term, a grade matters much less than the kind of person you believe you
are and what your actions show you to be.</p>
<p>We’ve put in a fair bit of thinking and effort to make things easier
for you this term with our system of grading, the chance to re-take
quizzes, etc. We need to balance the need to get an accurate assessment
of your success in learning with making your lives reasaonably bearable.
To take advantage of us as we’re trying to do things the right way is
wrong and does you damage.</p>
<p>All the best in these difficult times of pandemic and online
learning! We hope you do great on quizzes, projects, etc., but what we
want more is for you to be good people. We believe you can be and want
to be, so be that!</p>
<h2 id="sample-questions-practice-quiz">Sample Questions, Practice
Quiz</h2>
<p>(Under Construction!)</p>
<p>Here are some sample questions:</p>
<p><em>Sample Q1:</em> In the merge algorithm shown in class for
mergesort, one item from a sublist was moved after two items were
compared. For that comparison, we could choose use a &lt; or a &lt;=.
What affect does making a different choice in this have? Pick one of the
following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Merge now works in such a way that mergesort does not produce
correct results.</li>
<li>Mergesort still works correctly, but its time-complexity order-class
changes.</li>
<li>Mergesort still works correctly, but this may affect its
stability.</li>
<li>None of the changes given in the previous choices could occur.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Sample Q2:</em> We did a type of proof to show that comparison
sorts that only swap adjacent items must do a minimum number of
comparisons to produce a correct result.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>This type of proof is called a ______________ (fill in the
blank).</li>
<li>True or false? This particular proof relies on a decision tree
argument.</li>
<li>This proof shows that in the worst-case __________ comparisons must
be done. (Give a precise formula, not an order class.)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="topics-that-will-be-covered-on-the-quiz-include">Topics that
will be covered on the quiz include:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Basic Terms and concepts: algorithm, basic operation,

<li>For Quicksort, what’s the recurrence of the worst-case? the
best-case?</li>
<li>What leads to the worst-case? How can we prevent this? (randomized
