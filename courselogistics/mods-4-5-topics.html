<a name="introduction"></a>Overview
---------------------------------------

Module 1's quiz is on lectures and readings from Feb. 1 through Feb. 24.  The following topic list is a guide, and we may update it before the quiz in response to student questions.  See the slides and recordings for more details and readings associated with these topics.  A basic rule we'll try to follow is this: if it's in the readings, but we didn't mention it in lecture, it will *not* be on the quiz.

<p>Document Version: 1.0, 10/14/2021</p>
<p>Note: the section the mentions the Wiring HW will be updated.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-quiz-will-be-given-and-other-rules">How the Quiz Will Be
Given and Other Rules</h2>
<p>The quizzes will first be given on paper and in-class on 10/19/2021.
You can try one or both of the quizzes in the class that day. On the 2nd
quiz day, TBD (watch for an update) you can re-take any or all of these.
You can also re-take any or all of these during the final exam
period.</p>
<p>The quizzes will be closed-book, closed-notes, etc. Getting
information from any electronic devices is not allowed while taking a
quiz. You will sign a pledge on each quiz paper.</p>
<p>It is an honor violation to communicate information about the quiz to
anyone who might not have yet taken it.</p>
<h2
id="topics-that-might-be-covered-on-the-module-4-quiz-include">Topics
that might be covered on the Module 4 quiz include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graphs
<ul>
<li>No specific questions on review from earlier courses, adjacency list
vs. matrix, etc., but understanding these topics may be needed in other
questions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>BFS
<ul>
<li>The strategy and algorithm, including use of queue, marking nodes,
levels of the tree, non-tree edges, time-complexity</li>
<li>BFS and shortest path to nodes in terms of edge weights</li>
<li>Proofs of correctness for BFS: know the basic ideas or strategies on
these (we won’t ask you to reproduce these proofs)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>DFS
<ul>
<li>The strategy and algorithm, including use of recursion, marking
nodes, levels of the tree, non-tree edges, discovery/finish times,
time-complexity, recognizing back-edges</li>
<li>No questions on version that uses stack, only recursive
approach</li>
<li>Using DFS-sweep() to process all nodes, find connected components,
etc.</li>
<li>For undirected graphs: back-edges mean cycles; edges only
categorized as tree or back-edges</li>
<li>For directed graphs: only back-edges mean cycles; also cross and
descendant edges (know these don’t indicate cycles, but you don’t know
how to distinguish between cross and descendent)</li>
<li>Using DFS to find a path between two vertices (if it exists)</li>
<li>Using DFS and/or BFS for problems: is graph acyclic, finding
connected components, other relatively simple problems done in lecture
etc.</li>
<li>Properties of BFS and DFS trees (some HW questions focused on these
trees)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Topological Sorting and SCCs in a Digraph
<ul>
<li>What the problem is Topological Sorting about, how its used to model
dependencies</li>
<li>Solution using DFS based on finish times</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Strongly connected components: what they are, how we use DFS and a
graph’s transpose to find these, relation to topological sorting</li>
</ul>
<h2
id="topics-that-might-be-covered-on-the-module-5-quiz-include">Topics
that might be covered on the Module 5 quiz include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm
<ul>
<li>The strategy and algorithm, how to find next edge to add to
solution, use of sorting or heap</li>
<li>The need and use of set operations Union and Find in Kruskal’s</li>
<li>The Find/Union data structure: the basics, union-by-rank,
path-compression</li>
<li>Time complexity for Kruskal’s with Find/Union and its
optimizations</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wiring Programming Homework
<ul>
<li>The general problem that needs to be solved, including hand
calculated solutions to simple test cases.</li>
<li>The ability to describe a solution, or parts of a solution, at a
high-level (e.g., describing which edges don’t need to be considered,
etc.).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="topics-that-will-not-be-covered-on-the-quiz-include">Topics that
will <em>not</em> be covered on the quiz include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>We won’t ask you to reproduce all the details of proofs on the
correctness of BFS but may ask questions about them</li>
<li>You don’t know how to distinguish between cross and descendent edges
in DFS</li>
</ul>
