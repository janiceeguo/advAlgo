<a name="introduction"></a>Introduction
---------------------------------------

The repository contains content for **Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms** at [the University of Virginia](https://virginia.edu). This course is designed to be an elective offering that explores advanced versions of foundational data structures (e.g., advanced array-based data structures and advanced tree data structures). The course also expands on a student's algorithmic toolset by exploring advanced approaches such as linear programming and advanced analysis (as in approximation algorithms).

Students are expected to have command of foundational concepts in Computer Science, including all data structures (arrays, lists, trees, hash tables, priority queues, graphs, etc.) as well algorithms (optimization methods, divide-and-conquer algorithms, dynamic programming, etc.)

<a name="headtas"></a>Instructor and Head TAs
------------------------------------------

We have one instructor and multiple **TAs** for the course. Their names and emails are shown in the table below. Instructors are often slow at responding and the TAs can sometimes more quickly address your concern or escalate the situation to an instructor if necessary.

[^1]: Adv. Algo. students are given preference during my Monday office hours. If any DMT2 students are present, you will be given priority in all cases.
[^2]: DMT2 students are given preference during my Thursday office hours. If any DMT2 students are present, they will given priority and you will have to wait. 


<a name="contributing"></a>Contributing to this Repository
----------------------------------------------------------

Updates to the repository are restricted to approved individuals only, to prevent anybody from messing with the slides right before a lecture.  However, others can still contribute to this repository -- to do so, take the following steps:

1. Create a github account, if you do not have one
2. Fork this repository: you can click on the "Fork" link in the upper right
3. Clone your forked repository on to your local machine
4. Make any changes you want to your forked version, then commit and push your changes back to your forked repository
5. Create a pull request, following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)

At that point, we will receive a notice that a change has been submitted, and I'll look at it and hopefully accept it into the main repository.

When you want to bring in the updates from the main dsa1 github repository into your forked repository, you will need to follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork).
